If you want to distribute a modified version of RealChute, be it code, textures, configs, or any other asset and piece of work, you must get my explicit permission on the matter through a private channel, and must also distribute it through the attribution clause, and must make it clear to anyone using your modification of my work that they must report any problem related to this usage to you, and not to me.

This repository is under the claim of the [right to backup](https://info.legalzoom.com/copyright-law-making-personal-copies-22200.html) and should be considered private:

In order to make a copy, you must own a valid copy of the software and must destroy or transfer your backup copy if you ever decide to sell, transfer or give away your original valid copy. It is not legal to sell a backup copy of software unless you are selling it along with the original.

I grant you no rights on any artifact on this repository, unless you own yourself the right to use the software and authorizes me to keep backups for you:
